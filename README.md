# Supervised-Learning-Cross-National-Cancer-Trends-An-Analytical-Approach-Using-ML-Classification
This project leverages supervised machine learning to predict cancer rates across nations using global socioeconomic, environmental, and health indicators. By applying models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests, along with data preprocessing and imbalance handling techniques, it uncovers key predictors of cancer trends.
